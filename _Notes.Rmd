R Basics
## Base objects

- "atomic" vector: vector of same type.

- scalar: this doesn't exist, there are only vectors of length 1.

- matrices/arrays: just an atomic vector with some dimensions (attribute).

- list: vector of elements with possible different types in it. 

- data.frame: a list whose elements have the same lengths, and formatted somewhat as a matrix.


Like "atomic" vectors, you can coerce between data structures with `as.` and `is.`.  In a few instances R will perform automatic coercion, usually between matrices and data frames.
