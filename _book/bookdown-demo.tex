\begin{quote}
``The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform
them quickly and so that human beings can understand them clearly. A
programmer is ideally an essayist who works with traditional aesthetic
and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts, to communicate the
way that an algorithm works and to convince a reader that the results
will be correct.'' Donald Knuth
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{reproducible-research}{%
\subsection{Reproducible Research}\label{reproducible-research}}

Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more
generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software
code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them. There
are two basic reasons to be concerned about making your research
reproducible. The first is \emph{to show evidence of the correctness of
your results}. The second reason to aspire to reproducibility is
\emph{to enable others to make use of our methods and results}.

\begin{quote}
``A key component of scientific communication is sufficient information
for other researchers in the field to reproduce published findings. For
computational and data-enabled research, this has often been interpreted
to mean making available the raw data from which results were generated,
the computer code that generated the findings, and any additional
information needed such as workflows and input parameters. Many journals
are revising author guidelines to include data and code availability. We
chose a random sample of 204 scientific papers published in the journal
\textbf{Science} after the implementation of their policy in February
2011. We found that were able to reproduce the findings for 26\%.''
\href{http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/2584}{Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America}
\end{quote}

Modern challenges of reproducibility in research, particularly
computational reproducibility, have produced a lot of discussion in
papers, blogs and videos, some of which are listed
\href{http://ropensci.github.io/reproducibility-guide/sections/references/}{here}
and \href{https://reproducibleresearch.net/}{here}.

\begin{quote}
``Starting September 1 2016, JASA ACS will require code and data as a
minimum standard for reproducibility of statistical scientific
research.''

identification.As noted in the FDA guidance, E9 Statistical Principles
for Clinical Trials (available at

``The computer software used for data management and statistical
analysis should be reliable, and documentation of appropriate software

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We will assume you have minimal experience and knowledge of R
\item
  IT should have installed:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \href{https://cran.r-project.org/}{R} version 3.5

\hypertarget{content}{%
\section{Content}\label{content}}

It is impossible to become an expert in R in only one course. Yet, this
course aims at giving a wide understanding on many aspects of R as used
in a corporate / production environment. It will roughly be based on
\href{http://r4ds.had.co.nz}{R for Data Science}. While this is an
\emph{excellent} resource it does not cover much of what we will need on
a routine basis. Some external resources will be referred to in this
book for you to be able to deepen what you would have learned in this
course.

This is your course so if you feel we need to hit an area deeper, or add
content based on a current need, let me know an we will work to adjust
it.

The \textbf{rough} topic list of the course:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Good programming practices
\item
  Basics of R Programming
\item
  Importing Data
\item
  Tiyding Data
\item
  Visualizing Data
\item
  Functions
\item
  Strings
\item
  Dates and Time
\item
  Communicating Results
\end{enumerate}

Making Code Production Ready:

\item
  Communicating Results (part II)
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{structure}{%
\section{Structure}\label{structure}}

My current thoughts are to meet an hour a week and discuss a topic. We
will not be going strictly through the R4DS, but will use it as our
foundation into the topic at hand. Then give an assignment due for the
next week which we go over the solutions. We will incorporate these
assignemnts into a RADARS R package so we will have a collection of
usefull reusable code

Open to other ideas.

I'm going to try to keep the assignments related to our current work
(maybe working through Site Investigator and/or Subscriber Reports) so
we can work on the class during work hours.

\hypertarget{good-practices}{%
\chapter{Good practices}\label{good-practices}}

\begin{quote}
``Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for
machines to execute.'' Harold Abelson
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
``Programming is the art of telling another human being what one wants
the computer to do.'' Donald Knuth
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
``Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of
programs. Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a
computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human
beings what we want a computer to do.'' Donald Knuth
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
``When you write a program, think of it primarily as a work of
literature. You're trying to write something that human beings are going
to read. Don't think of it primarily as something a computer is going to
follow. The more effective you are at making your program readable, the
more effective it's going to be: You'll understand it today, you'll
understand it next week, and your successors who are going to maintain
and modify it will understand it.''
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{coding-style}{%
\section{Coding style}\label{coding-style}}

Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without
it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread. When I answer questions; first, I
read the title of the question to see if I can answer the question,
secondly, I check the coding style of the question and if the code is
too difficult to read, I just move on. Please make your code readable by
following e.g. \href{http://style.tidyverse.org/}{this coding style}
(examples below come from this guide).

\hypertarget{comments}{%
\subsection{Comments}\label{comments}}

In code, use comments to explain the ``why'' not the ``what'' or
``how''. Each line of a comment should begin with the comment symbol and
a single space: \texttt{\#}.

\hypertarget{naming}{%
\subsection{Naming}\label{naming}}

Names are not limited to 8 characters as in some other languages. Be
smart with your naming; be descriptive yet concise.

Throughout the course will point out some standard naming conventions
that are used in R (and other languages). (Ex. \texttt{i} and \texttt{j}
as row and column indicies)

\hypertarget{structure-1}{%
\subsection{Structure}\label{structure-1}}

Use commented lines of \texttt{-} to create code outline.

\hypertarget{spacing}{%
\subsection{Spacing}\label{spacing}}

Put a space before and after \texttt{=} when naming arguments in
function calls. Most infix operators (\texttt{==}, \texttt{+},
\texttt{-}, \texttt{\textless{}-}, etc.) are also surrounded by spaces,
except those with relatively high precedence: \texttt{\^{}}, \texttt{:},
\texttt{::}, and \texttt{:::}. Always put a space after a comma, and
never before (just like in regular English).

\hypertarget{long-lines}{%
\subsection{Long lines}\label{long-lines}}

Strive to limit your code to 80 characters per line. This fits
comfortably on a printed page with a reasonably sized font. If you find
yourself running out of room, this is a good indication that you should
encapsulate some of the work in a separate function.

If a function call is too long to fit on a single line, use one line
each for the function name, each argument, and the closing \texttt{)}.
This makes the code easier to read and to change later.

well on complex problems. A convenient solution to see all the
variables' states in your code is to place some \texttt{browser()}
anywhere you want to check the variables' states.

Can't remember useful functions? Use
\href{https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/}{cheat sheets}.

You can search for specific R stuff on \url{https://rseek.org/}. You
should also read documentations carefully. If you're using a package,
search for vignettes and a GitHub repository.

You can also use \href{https://stackoverflow.com/}{Stack Overflow}. The
most common use of Stack Overflow is when you have an error or a
question, you google it, and most of the times the first links are Q/A
on Stack Overflow.

You can ask questions on Stack Overflow (using the tag \texttt{r}). You
need to
\href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example}{make
a great R reproducible example} if you want your question to be
answered. Most of the times, while making this reproducible example, you
will find the answer to your problem.

If you're confident enough in your R skills, you can go to the next step
and
\href{https://stackoverflow.com/unanswered/tagged/r?tab=newest}{answer
questions on Stack Overflow}. It's a good way to increase your skills,
or just to
