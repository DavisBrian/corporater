Something that will make life easier in the long-run can be the most
difficult thing to do today. For coders, prioritising the long term may
involve an overhaul of current practice and the learning of a new skill.

\section{Course Philosophy}\label{course-philosophy}}

\begin{quote}
``The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform
them quickly and so that human beings can understand them clearly. A
programmer is ideally an essayist who works with traditional aesthetic
and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts, to communicate the
way that an algorithm works and to convince a reader that the results
will be correct.'' Donald Knuth
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{reproducible-research}{%
\subsection{Reproducible Research}\label{reproducible-research}}

Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more
generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software
code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them. There
are two basic reasons to be concerned about making your research
reproducible. The first is \emph{to show evidence of the correctness of
your results}. The second reason to aspire to reproducibility is
\emph{to enable others to make use of our methods and results}.

Modern challenges of reproducibility in research, particularly
computational reproducibility, have produced a lot of discussion in
papers, blogs and videos, some of which are listed
\href{http://ropensci.github.io/reproducibility-guide/sections/references/}{here}
and \href{https://reproducibleresearch.net/}{here}.

\begin{quote}
Conclusions in experimental psychology often are the result of null
hypothesis significance testing. Unfortunately, there is evidence ((from
eight major psychology journals published between 1985 and 2013) that
roughly half of all published empirical psychology articles contain at
least one inconsistent p-value, and around one in eight articles contain
a grossly inconsistent p-value that makes a non-significant result seem
significant, or vice versa.

\begin{quote}
``A key component of scientific communication is sufficient information
for other researchers in the field to reproduce published findings. For
computational and data-enabled research, this has often been interpreted
to mean making available the raw data from which results were generated,
the computer code that generated the findings, and any additional
information needed such as workflows and input parameters. Many journals
are revising author guidelines to include data and code availability. We
chose a random sample of 204 scientific papers published in the journal
\textbf{Science} after the implementation of their policy in February
2011. We found that were able to reproduce the findings for 26\%.''

Contray to what we hear the FDA does not require SAS to be used
\emph{EVER}. There are instances that you have to deliver data in XPORT
format though which is open and implemented in many programming
languages.

\begin{quote}
``FDA does not require use of any specific software for statistical
analyses, and statistical software is not explicitly discussed in Title
21 of the Code of Federal Regulations {[}e.g., in 21CFR part 11{]}.
However, the software package(s) used for statistical analyses should be
fully documented in the submission, including version and build
identification. As noted in the FDA guidance, E9 Statistical Principles
for Clinical Trials''

\section{Prerequisites}\label{prerequisites}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We will assume you have minimal experience and knowledge of R
\item
  IT should have installed:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \href{https://cran.r-project.org/}{R} version 3.5
  \item
    \href{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/\#download}{RStudio}
    version 1.1
  \item
    \href{https://miktex.org/}{MiTeX}
  \item
    \href{https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/}{RTools}
    version 3.4
  \end{itemize}
\item
  We will install other dependencies throughout the course.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{content}{%
\section{Content}\label{content}}

It is impossible to become an expert in R in only one course even a
multi-week one. Yet, this course aims at giving a wide understanding on
many aspects of R as used in a corporate / production environment. It
will roughly be based on \href{http://r4ds.had.co.nz}{R for Data
Science}. While this is an \emph{excellent} resource it does not cover
much of what we will need on a routine basis. Some external resources
will be referred to in this book for you to be able to deepen what you
would have learned in this course.

This is your course so if you feel we need to hit an area deeper, or add
content based on a current need, let me know an we will work to adjust
it.

The \textbf{rough} topic list of the course:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Good programming practices
\item
  Basics of R Programming
\item
  Importing Data
\item
  Tiyding Data
\item
  Visualizing Data
\item
  Functions
\item
  Strings
\item
  Dates and Time
\item
  Communicating Results
\end{enumerate}

Making Code Production Ready:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{9}
\tightlist
\item
  Functions (part II)
\item
  Assertions
\item
  Unit tests
\item
  Documentation
\item
  Communicating Results (part II)
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{structure}{%
\section{Structure}\label{structure}}

My current thoughts are to meet an hour a week and discuss a topic. We
will not be going strictly through the R4DS, but will use it as our
foundation into the topic at hand. Then give an assignment due for the
next week which we go over the solutions. We will incorporate these
assignments into a RADARS R package(s?) so we will have a collection of
usefull reusable code for the future.

Open to other ideas as we go along. I'm going to try to keep the
assignments related to our current work (maybe working through Site
Investigator and/or Subscriber Reports) so we can work on the class
during work hours.
