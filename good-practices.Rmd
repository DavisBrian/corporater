> “Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.” Harold Abelson

> "Programming is the art of telling another human being what one wants the computer to do." Donald Knuth

> "Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs. Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do." Donald Knuth

> "When you write a program, think of it primarily as a work of literature. You're trying to write something that human beings are going to read. Don't think of it primarily as something a computer is going to follow. The more effective you are at making your program readable, the more effective it's going to be: You'll understand it today, you'll understand it next week, and your successors who are going to maintain and modify it will understand it."

## Coding style

Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread. When I answer questions; first, I read the title of the question to see if I can answer the question, secondly, I check the coding style of the question and if the code is too difficult to read, I just move on. Please make your code readable by following e.g. [this coding style](http://style.tidyverse.org/) (most examples below come from this guide).

### Comments

In code, use comments to explain the “why” not the “what” or “how”. Each line of a comment should begin with the comment symbol and a single space: `#`.

### Naming


> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.
> -- Phil Karlton
Names are not limited to 8 characters as in some other languages.  Be smart with your naming; be descriptive yet concise. Think about how your names will show up in autocomplete.

Throughout the course we will point out some standard naming conventions that are used in R (and other languages).  (Ex. `i` and `j` as row and column indicies)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Good
average_height <- mean((feet / 12) + inches)
plot(mtcars$disp, mtcars$mpg)

# Bad
ah<-mean(x/12+y)
plot(mtcars[, 3], mtcars[, 1])
```


### Structure

Use commented lines of `-` to create a code outline.

### Spacing

Put a space before and after `=` when naming arguments in function calls.
Most infix operators (`==`, `+`, `-`, `<-`, etc.) are also surrounded by
spaces, except those with relatively high precedence: `^`, `:`, `::`, and `:::`. Always put a space after a comma, and never before (just like in regular English).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Good
average <- mean((feet / 12) + inches, na.rm = TRUE)
sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
x <- 1:10
base::sum

# Bad
average<-mean(feet/12+inches,na.rm=TRUE)
sqrt(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2)
x <- 1 : 10
base :: sum
```

### Indenting

Curly braces, `{}`, define the the most important hierarchy of R code. To make this hierarchy easy to see, always indent the code inside `{}` by two spaces.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Good
if (y < 0 && debug) {
  message("y is negative")
}

if (y == 0) {
  if (x > 0) {
    log(x)
  } else {
    message("x is negative or zero")
  }
} else {
  y ^ x
}

# Bad
if (y < 0 && debug)
message("Y is negative")

if (y == 0)
{
    if (x > 0) {
      log(x)
    } else {
  message("x is negative or zero")
    }
} else { y ^ x }
```

### Long lines

Strive to limit your code to 80 characters per line. This fits comfortably on a
printed page with a reasonably sized font. If you find yourself running out of
room, this is a good indication that you should encapsulate some of the work
into a separate function.

If a function call is too long to fit on a single line, use one line each for
the function name, each argument, and the closing `)`. This makes the code
easier to read and to change later.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Good
do_something_very_complicated(
  something = "that",
  requires  = many,
  arguments = "some of which may be long"
)

# Bad
do_something_very_complicated("that", requires, many, arguments,
                              "some of which may be long"
```

### Other

- Use `<-`, not `=`, for assignment. Keep `=` for parameters.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Good
x <- 5
system.time(
  x <- rnorm(1e6)
)

# Bad
x = 5
system.time(
  x = rnorm(1e6)
)
```

- Don't put `;` at the end of a line, and don't use `;` to put multiple commands 
on one line.

- Only use `return()` for early returns. Otherwise rely on R to return the result of the last evaluated expression.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Good
add_two <- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}

# Bad
add_two <- function(x, y) {
  return(x + y)
}
```

- Use `"`, not `'`, for quoting text. The only exception is when the text already contains double quotes and no single quotes.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Good
"Text"
'Text with "quotes"'
'<a href="http://style.tidyverse.org">A link</a>'

# Bad
'Text'
'Text with "double" and \'single\' quotes'
```

## Coding practices

### Variables

Create variables for values that are likely to change.

### *Rule of 3* 

Try not to copy code, or copy then modify the code, more than twice.

-  If a change requires you to search/replace 3 or more times make a variable.
-  If you copy a code chunk 3 or more times *make a function*
-  If you copy a function 3 or more times *make your function more generic*
-  If you copy a function 3 or more times into a project *make a package*
-  If 3 or more people will use the function *make a package*
-  If 3 or more projects will use the function *make a package*

Same thing goes for lookup tables and such.  The key thing to think about is; if
something changes how many touch points will there be?  If it is 3 or more
places it is time to abstract this code a bit.


### Path names

It is better to use relative path names instead of hard coded ones.  If you must read from (or write to) paths that are not in your project directory structure create a file name variable at the highest level you can (*always end with the `/`*) and then use relative paths.   
**DO NOT EVER USE `setwd()`**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Good
raw_data <- read.csv("./data/mydatafile.csv") 

input_file <- "./data/mydatafile.csv"
raw_data <- read.csv(input_file)  

input_path <- "C:/Path/To/Some/other/project/directory/"
input_file <- paste0(input_path, "data/mydatafile.csv")
raw_data <- read.csv(input_file)

# Bad
setwd("C:/Path/To/Some/other/project/directory/data/")
raw_data <- read.csv("mydatafile.csv")
setwd("C:/Path/back/to/my/project/")
```

## RStudio

Download the latest version of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) (> 1.1) and use it!

Learn more about new features of RStudio v1.1 [there](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/rstudio-1-1-new-features/).

RStudio features:

- everything you can expect from a good IDE
- keyboard shortcuts I use frequently
    1. *Ctrl + Space* (auto-completion, better than *Tab*)
    2. *Ctrl + Up* (command history & search)
    3. *Ctrl + Enter* (execute line of code)
    4. *Ctrl + Shift + A* (reformat code)
    5. *Ctrl + Shift + C* (comment/uncomment selected lines)
    6. *Ctrl + Shift + /* (reflow comments)
    7. *Ctrl + Shift + O* (View code outline)
    8. *Ctrl + Shift + B* (build package, website or book)
    9. *Ctrl + Shift + M* (pipe)
    10. *Alt + Shift + K* to see all shortcuts...
- Panels (everything is integrated, including **Git** and a terminal)
- Interactive data importation from files and connections (see [this webinar](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/importing-data-into-r/))
- Use [code diagnostics](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/205753617-Code-Diagnostics):

- **R Projects**: 
    - **Meaningful structure** in one folder
    - The working directory automatically switches to the project's folder
    - File tab displays the associated files and folders in the project
    - History of R commands and open files
    - Any settings associated with the project, such as Git settings, are loaded. Note that a *set-up.R* or even a *.Rprofile* file in the project's root directory enable project-specific settings to be loaded each time people work on the project.

## Getting help

### Help yourself, learn how to debug

A basic solution is to print everything, but it usually does not work well on complex problems. A convenient solution to see all the variables' states in your code is to place some `browser()` anywhere you want to check the variables' states.
